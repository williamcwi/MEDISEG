# MEDISEG: MEDication Image SEGmentation Dataset

## Overview

MEDISEG is a novel benchmark dataset developed to address the limitations of existing pill datasets in real-world scenarios. Unlike current datasets that predominantly feature single-pill images with incomplete or missing annotations, MEDISEG captures the complexity of naturally occurring conditionsâ€”such as multiple pills in blister packs under varied lighting and environmental settings. Every image in the dataset is meticulously annotated with instance segmentation masks, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating advanced pill recognition models.

## Motivation

Existing publicly available pill datasetsâ€”namely the NIH Pillbox and CURE datasetsâ€”have notable drawbacks. The NIH Pillbox dataset, while historically valuable, is no longer maintained (the Pillbox program was retired on January 29, 2021). Although an archive of reference images remains, these images lack the corresponding annotation files and consumer images essential for robust model training. MEDISEG fills this gap by offering comprehensive segmentation annotations on images that reflect real-world conditions, thus supporting improved performance in practical applications.
